        \item Participated as an instructor in the Urban Scholars program,
            which assists academically advanced but economically disadvantaged
            or first-generation college bound high school and middle school
            students.  The program provides afternoon classes, summer school,
            and tutoring, to assist students with making it to college.
            Students in good standing are paid a stipend to enable them to
            spend time learning rather than working.

        \item Designed and proposed my own courses on Beginning Robotics,
            Advanced Robotics, and Intro Programming, working them in with the
            new Common Core standards for a balanced curriculum.  Met weekly

		{\emph{February 2012 -- June 2013}}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Started a business with my retired mentor from NASA\@.  I helped
            organize the company, including financial records and professional
            contacts, and helped build a small team of skilled engineers.  I
            worked to keep the team on-task and divided work appropriately.

        \item With a team, designed and implemented a prototype electronics box
            to control robotic arms with inverse kinematic endpoint control and
            PID feedback loops.  These arms used a variety of devices,
            including servos, DC motors, potentiometers, magnetic and absolute
            encoders, and linear actuators.  The control algorithm was
            developed on a Maple development board after being prototyped in
            Python.  These control boxes may see military service soon.  I
            designed the circuit, wrote the low-level I/O functions to enable
            the microcontroller to communicate with the sensors and motors, and
            helped solve the inverse kinematic equations.

        \item Made business plans with a patent holder for a germicidal UVC
            light device, and designed a prototype with a team. The device is
            an embedded light fixture containing a UVC bulb and moving shutter
            that can alternately sanitize the air or irradiate the surfaces in
            the room if it detects that no one is present.  The prototype used
            an assortment of sensors and 802.15.4 wireless mesh communication.
            Personally wrote the embedded firmware and designed a communication
            protocol.  Deliverables included the prototype device, prototype
            control software, and engineering documentation.

        \item Under a new contract, continued work on a software-defined radio
            project in McMurdo, Antarctica that I started for NASA with NOAA's
            POES satellites during the summer of 2011 (see Goddard Space Flight
            Center, below).  I returned to Antarctica in December 2012 to
            verify that my system was functional, record data, and retrograde
            the 28-year old ground station.  All equipment was tested and
            packaged for return to NASA Goddard.  The ground station was
            prepared for a new team of NASA engineers.

		{\emph{June 2011 -- Aug 2011}}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Arrived early and familiarized myself with current projects.
            When other interns arrived, gave presentations to them and assisted
            in dividing work based on individual strengths.  Coordinated group
            work and managed all contact information.

        \item Started a project using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral
            (USRP) with GNU Radio to design and implement a software-defined
            radio for the NASA Antarctic Interactive Launch Support (NAILS)
            system at the NASA Satellite Ground Station in McMurdo, Antarctica.
            The system replaces outdated analog signal processing equipment to
            receive, demodulate, and decode L-band and S-band satellite
            communications from NOAA's Polar Operational Environmental
            Satellites (POES).  I personally installed a \$6,000 Linux server
            and my software-defined radio in the NAILS server racks during a
            trip to McMurdo in December 2011 with a small team of NASA
            engineers.  I returned in December 2012 to continue work (see SPI
            Team, above).

        \item Coordinated the LIDAR-Assisted Robotic Group Exploration (LARGE)
            project, using multiple robots with 3D SLAM to generate cohesive
            mapping data.  The robots ran ROS and took input from a 360\degree\
            LIDAR, a Kinect, quadrature encoders, and laser rangefinders.  Main
            software challenges include image stitching, navigation, obstacle
            avoidance, and directing multiple specialized workerbots from the
            mothership.  Robotic arms were being developed in parallel.  The
            goal of the project was to demonstrate the viability of
            implementation on Mars and other planets.

            \item Built a MEAN stack database and client-side application for
                managing recipes with MongoDB, Node.js, and Angular.js.  The
                server allows family and friends to add, edit, and comment on
                recipes in one central location, rather than maintaining a long
                list of bookmarks or physical binder.  It's designed for mobile

        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Glorb}}{\emph{Spring 2013}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With my wife, designed and prototyped a science education
                project for MIT\@.  Glorbs are a whiffle ball containing a
                circuit with an AVR ATmega, an accelerometer, a lithium-ion
                battery pack, and a bunch of RGB LEDs.  The LEDs change color
                in response to acceleration -- red for freefall, blue for high
                acceleration.  The goal is to explore physics and principles of
                acceleration by playing catch with them.  Glorbs give learners
                concrete visual feedback about the acceleration forces on a
                ball during the course of normal play.  We presented this at
                the MIT Media Lab's Other Festival in Spring 2013.

        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Motion Lights}}{\emph{2013}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With spare PIR motion sensors and AVR chips, prototyped a
                power-efficient motion-triggered relay with AA batteries and
                tunable delay before shutoff.  This is small enough to fit in a
                junction box behind a lightswitch.  The lightswitch being on
                the wrong side of the kitchen is no longer an issue.
