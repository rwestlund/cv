	\begin{itemize}
        \item Founded a startup company to provide specialized project
            management software for the awning industry.

        \item Prototyped and deployed a beta version of Awning Tracker on a
            MEAN stack.

        \item Created the final Awning Tracker platform as a client-side web
            application using web components and the Polymer framework.
            Implemented the back end with PostgreSQL and Go.

        \item Managed a large number of Awning Tracker instances across
            multiple FreeBSD servers and jails, including replicating backups
            to multiple data centers.  Designed the architecture and wrote
            custom automation and monitoring tools.

        \item Created advertisements and ran marketing campaigns across various
            platforms.

        \item Met with clients and led in-person training seminars.  Provided
            24/7 support.

        \item Led business meetings with clients to study paper-driven
            workflows and discuss areas where technology could improve

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Took the primary role in developing SLOOP, a pattern retrieval
            engine for animal biometrics.  SLOOP helps biologists identify
            individual members of a species from a collection of photographs to
            model population over time.

        \item Redesigned the system from the ground up, implementing a RESTful
            API using Node.js, and Angular.js for the new mobile-friendly
            client-side application and management console. Expanded the system
            to handle new species.  Improved reliability by migrating all data
            from the filesystem to a PostgreSQL database.  Packaged the system
            into a deployable virtual machine.

        \item Traveled solo to New Zealand to upgrade and relocate the
            Department of Conservation's existing SLOOP system.

		{\emph{Systems Engineer via E5 Aeronautics}}
		{\emph{July 2013 -- Present}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed embedded systems and communication protocols for small
            unmanned aircraft for civilian use.  Explored
            issues such as mesh networking, low-latency remote control, and
            redundant sensor systems.  Used MAVLink and custom communication
            protocols.

        \item Cross compiled and deployed a custom NanoBSD image to embedded
            boards to provide communications over 900 MHz.  Implemented
            realtime video and telemetry feeds from the aircraft to the ground.

        \item Modified firmware for Wi-Fi SD cards and Canon cameras with CHDK,
            wrote custom device drivers for 900 MHz radios, and deployed to an
            embedded Linux development board.  Utilized memory-mapped files to
            meet near realtime message passing requirements.

        \item Tested unmanned aerial systems (UAS/UAV) at Popocat√©petl, an active
            volcano in Mexico. Flew aircraft through the volcano's plume to
            collect environmental data.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Textplain}}{\emph{April 2015}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Built a personal website without a CMS using Django,
                PostgreSQL, and Nginx.  The site avoids the use of client-side
                javascript yet still follows a mobile-first design philosophy.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Recipes}}{\emph{December 2014}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Built a MEAN stack database and client-side application for
                managing recipes with MongoDB, Node.js, and Angular.js.  The
                server allows family and friends to add, edit, and comment on
                recipes in one central location, rather than maintaining a long
                list of bookmarks or physical binder.  It's designed for mobile
                use and easy to use from the kitchen.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Glorb}}{\emph{Spring 2013}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With my wife, designed and prototyped a science education
                project for MIT\@.  Glorbs are a whiffle ball containing a
                circuit with an AVR ATmega, an accelerometer, a lithium-ion
                battery pack, and a bunch of RGB LEDs.  The LEDs change color
                in response to acceleration -- red for freefall, blue for high
                acceleration.  The goal is to explore physics and principles of
                acceleration by playing catch with them.  Glorbs give learners
                concrete visual feedback about the acceleration forces on a
                ball during the course of normal play.  We presented this at
                the MIT Media Lab's Other Festival in Spring 2013.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \headerrow{\textbf{Motion Lights}}{\emph{2013}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item With spare PIR motion sensors and AVR chips, prototyped a
                power-efficient motion-triggered relay with AA batteries and
                tunable delay before shutoff.  This is small enough to fit in a
                junction box behind a lightswitch.  The lightswitch being on
                the wrong side of the kitchen is no longer an issue.
